# KrystalZhang-SugarCrush Game App
My replica of one of the world’s most famous games CandyCrush mainly using JavaScript. Same to CandyCrush, this replica allows the player to cancel candies whenever they have accumulated three consecutive same-branded candies in row or column, with a score the player getting simultaneously on-side.
